# Calendar Maker

## About

This program generates printable text files of monthly calendars for the month and year you enter. 
Dates and calendars are a tricky topic in programming because there are so many different rules for 
determining the number of days in a month, which years are leap years, and which day of the week a 
particular date falls on. Fortunately, Pythonâ€™s datetime module handles these details for you. This 
program focuses on generating the multiline string for the monthly calendar page.
